"""HTTP front end for the event broker, so subscribers can live in other processes.

`event_broker.Event` is in-process: `subscribe()` holds a Python function and
`emit()` calls it on the caller's thread. That is fine inside one program, but
the agents that need these events run as separate services. This module wraps
the same broker in a FastAPI app and hands each HTTP subscriber a Server-Sent
Events stream, so "register a callback" becomes "hold open a GET request".

The broker itself is untouched - it is still the thing doing the fan-out, and it
is still usable directly for in-process callers and tests.

    GET  /subscribe?tag=press   open an SSE stream (repeatable; omit for all tags)
    POST /emit                  inject one event
    POST /replay                play the scripted crisis feed once
    GET  /tags                  tags the scripted feed uses
    GET  /health                liveness + current subscriber count
