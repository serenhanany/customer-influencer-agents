"""
Behavioral test for CeoAgent's plan-solve pattern, run against the MCP gateway.

Goal: hand the CEO a situation rather than an instruction -- consumer safety
complaints about production batch 4471, matching the safety_concern tickets
sitting in the Customer Support queue -- and check what it actually does with
the tools it has: whether it looks before it acts, and whether it speaks in
public.

The CEO's tool surface here is the gateway's (gateway/): the support queue,
the analytics research surface, and the two public-voice tools its role is
allowed in roles.yaml. See GatewayToolAdapter and setup_gateway_tools in
gateway_bridge.py. Requires the gateway's own servers reachable
(docker compose up -d social-network customer-support-mcp) -- if they are
not, the run continues with no tools at all; see the printed warning.

There is no email in this scenario. `services/mail_client.py` talks to an
HTTP API that nothing in this repo serves, so Send_Email / Check_Inbox are
not registered.

Run with:  python main.py   (from ceo_agent/)
